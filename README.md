# River Tech FE Interview

## Instructions

### Requirements

Create a mini movie website which contains;

- Do not use Angular's `async` pipe
- Use Angular Signals
- Home page \* List top 10 popular movies
- Side menu \* Links to `home` and `movies`
- Movies page
  _ List of all movies
  _ Search
  _ When the user types inside the search field, the movies list should update in real time with the results
  _ There should be a 500ms delay between the user typing and updating of results \* The URL should contain the `search term` as a query param
  - Drop down filter by genre
    _ Dropdown should be a multi-select, user must be able to select multiple genres
    _ User should have an option to clear all selected genres
    _ Clicking an already selected genre deselects it
    _ When selecting/deselecting a genre from the list, it should be reflected inside the URL \* Genre list should be updated depending on the searched results only
  - Search and genres filtering should work in conjunction e.g. `http://localhost:4200/movies?searchTerm=dragon&genre=Adventure`
    - Refreshing should keep the user's filter / search
    - Clearing the search should not clear the movie genre filter and vice versa
- Movie page
  _ Contains the movie poster and all the movie details
  _ `Title`
  _ `Genres`
  _ `Popularity` rounded to 2 decimal places
  _ `Budget` Currency set to Euro
  _ Use the `Movie.slug` for the `URL` param
- Last Visited Movies
  _ At the bottom for all pages, have a section called `Last Visited`
  _ Movie is considered as `Last Visited` when the user has navigated to the Movie Page
  _ Only Show the 5 last recently visited movies
  _ Should not contain duplicate movies
  _ Should be ordered by last visited first
  _ Should be persisted even after the user refreshes the browser
- Linting
  - Project should pass all lint rules

### Technical Details

- The solution should be built using Angular, SCSS and TypeScript.
- Use Redux; The scaffolding provided already has `ngxs` installed, you may use other libraries if you want.
- Use the data provided inside the scaffolding `movie.mock-data.json` (There should be no alterations to the data provided)
- You may use any libraries or plug-ins you wish to fulfill the requirements.

### Rating

- You may create the solution however you want, these are key things we will look for;
  - All requirements are met
  - Best practices
  - Code structure, readability and reusability
  - Error handling
  - Performance considerations
  - RxJS operators usage
  - Redux State
  - Modelling data with TypeScript
  - Polished Design
  - SCSS usage

## Development

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Lint

Run `npm run lint` to lint the project. This will lint both `ts` and `scss` files.
